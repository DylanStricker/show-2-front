# Site for logging your shows #
Concept for a website that stores the shows you want to watch, have watched, and
haven't heard of.
Ideally The site will be kind of a forum that allows for discussion and the such
but also tracks the details of each show and personal thoughts on shows (could
be thought of as reviews but are more free form --general opinions etc).

### Tech used #
* React
* React Router
* Python
* Django
* Bootstrap
* Axios

### API Documentation
[Back-End-Link]https://github.com/DylanStricker/back-end-show-site

### Planning and Organization #
0. Back end design
1. Created wireframe and user stories
2. Create HTML
3. Create jquery response for events
4. Create UI response
5. Add error handlers


### User Stories #

* I want to be able to sign up
* I want to be able to sign-in
* I want to be able to change my password
* I want to be able to sign-out
* I want to be able to add a show to my watched shows
* I want to be able to see who made the show
* I want to be able to see when the show came out
* I want to be able to see a description of the show
* I want to be able to write about the shows I've seen
* I want to be able to search from a list of shows already stored

### Wireframes #
Went digital with this Wireframe, my physical ones didn't turn out that well so
